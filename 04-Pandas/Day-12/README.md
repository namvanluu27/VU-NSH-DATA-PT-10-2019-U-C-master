## 4.3 Lesson Plan - Merging and Data Clean Project

### Overview

Today's lesson is split into two parts. The first part will test the class' Pandas skills by having them look through buggy code and fixing the problems so it functions properly. The second part will require students to use all the tools they have learned this week to fully understand the concept of data engineering.
