## 5.3 Lesson Plan: Introduction to Statistics

### Overview

Today's class reviews summary statistics previously taught in Unit 1 and covers the implementation of these statistical measures in Python. This lesson also introduces new statistical concepts such as sample versus population, standard error, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression.

### Class Objectives

By the end of this class, students will be able to:

* Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance and standard deviation using Python.

* Plot, characterize, and quantify a normally distributed dataset using Python.

* Qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential outliers in a dataset.

* Differentiate between a sample and a population in regards to a dataset.

* Define and quantify correlation between two factors.

* Calculate and plot a linear regression in Python.
